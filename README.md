I'm not creative enough to write something meaningful here. Help :(
    Don't worry friend, I've got a little story for you. Once upon a time, there was a king and a monster. The monster desired a name. The king told him he had to earn one. So he traveled across the land questing for a name. Finding none, he found his journey's end where he began, at the king's side.
